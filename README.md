for more instructions on how to install Python on your operating system.

Email me at **arianne.dee.studios** at gmail.com if you need help troubleshooting 
your Python installation. 

#### On Mac
Go to https://www.python.org/downloads/.

Download the installer for the latest version of Python. 
Follow the prompts to install using the default settings.

#### On Windows
Either download the latest version of Python from the Windows Store,
or download and run the installer from https://www.python.org/downloads/.

If running the Python.org installer, it will also install the Windows
[Python Launcher](https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#launcher).
Before installing, read [this](docs/WININSTALL.md) to see some of the default configurations you may want to change.

#### On Linux
Since there are so many Linux distributions, there is no official installer for Python.

Some options:
1. Use your package manager (e.g. `$ sudo apt-get install python3.12`)
2. Build from source code. See the [CPython tutorial](https://realpython.com/cpython-source-code-guide/#compiling-cpython-linux) for instructions.
3. Download and install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) if you're going to be doing data analysis
4. Install [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) to manage and install Python
