"""
ChatGPT (Python) response to the query:
 Write a function that, given a target word and a guessed word, returns a result like in Wordle,
 with one character to mark a letter in the correct place, another to mark a character in the wrong place,
 and another to mark incorrect characters.

 Can you give me some tests for it in pytest?
