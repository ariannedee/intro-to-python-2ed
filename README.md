# Introduction to Python 2nd Edition
This is the code for **Introduction to Python 2nd Edition** by Arianne Dee

To get started with this course, please follow these instructions:
1. [Download the code](#1-download-the-course-files)
2. [Install Python](#2-install-python3)
3. [Install a code editor](#3-install-a-code-editor)
4. [Check that Python was installed properly](#4-make-sure-you-can-run-the-code)

## Set up instructions

### 1. Download the course files

**Note:** There are video instructions in Lesson 1.1

At the top of this page (at https://github.com/ariannedee/intro-to-python-2ed),
click the green 
<img src="docs/img/CodeButton.png" style="width: 90px;">
button.

If you have git installed, clone the repository.

If you don't know git, click "Download ZIP",
unzip the folder `intro-to-python-2ed-main`
and move it to a convenient location on your computer.

### 2. Install Python 3

**Note:** There are video instructions in Lesson 1.1

You can reference this [Real Python tutorial](https://realpython.com/installing-python)
for more instructions on how to install Python on your operating system.

Email me at **arianne.dee.studios** at gmail.com if you need help troubleshooting 
your Python installation. 

#### On Mac
Go to https://www.python.org/downloads/.

Download the installer for the latest version of Python. 
Follow the prompts to install using the default settings.

#### On Windows
Either download the latest version of Python from the Windows Store,
or download and run the installer from https://www.python.org/downloads/.

If running the Python.org installer, it will also install the Windows
[Python Launcher](https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#launcher).
Before installing, read [this](docs/WININSTALL.md) to see some of the default configurations you may want to change.

#### On Linux
Since there are so many Linux distributions, there is no official installer for Python.

Some options:
1. Use your package manager (e.g. `$ sudo apt-get install python3.12`)
2. Build from source code. See the [CPython tutorial](https://realpython.com/cpython-source-code-guide/#compiling-cpython-linux) for instructions.
3. Download and install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) if you're going to be doing data analysis
4. Install [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) to manage and install Python

### 3. Install a code editor

**Note:** There are video instructions in Lesson 1.2

The video uses PyCharm Community. 
You are free to download and use an alternate IDE, like VS Code, Spyder, etc.
You can also use IDLE, the code editor that comes with Python.

#### PyCharm
Go to https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/.

**Note**: you will have to scroll down past the Professional edition to get to the free Community Edition download link.

You can also use the Professional Edition if you will be using Python for work. 
It has better support for working with Jupyter notebooks, creating web apps,
working with databases and containers, and more.
There is a 30-day free trial.

Install, open, and use the default settings.

#### Visual Studio Code
Go to https://code.visualstudio.com/Download.

Once installed and opened, get the official [Python extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python).

#### Spyder
If you installed Python via [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/),
Spyder will already be installed and available to run via the Anaconda Navigator.

Otherwise, you can use the installer from https://www.spyder-ide.org/ on Mac or Windows.

### 4. Make sure you can run the code

**Note:** There are video instructions in Lesson 1.2

1. Open your code editor of choice

1. Open the `intro-to-python-2ed-main` folder (make sure it's unzipped first)

1. Open the `examples/example_1_first_code.py` file

1. Run it. It should run successfully with no errors.

See Lesson 1.2 for instructions on how to run files in the different code editors.

If you are having errors running the file,
follow [these steps](docs/PYTHON-IDE.md) to configure your code editor with the
correct version of Python.

## Troubleshooting

### I downloaded PyCharm Professional and it's saying I'm on a 30-day trial

Go back to https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/ and scroll down until
you see the Community Edition, which is always free.

### I'm still having trouble setting everything up

Email me at **arianne.dee.studios** at gmail.com with any relevant 
error messages and screenshots.
